      <h3>About Joey diaz</h3>
      <p>José Antonio Díaz (born February 19, 1963), known  professionally as Joey &quot;CoCo&quot; Diaz, is a Cuban-American stand-up  comedian, actor, and podcaster. After pursuing stand-up comedy full time in  1991 in the Colorado and Seattle areas, Diaz relocated to Los Angeles in 1995  where he began acting, securing various film and television roles, including My  Name Is Earl, The Longest Yard, Spider-Man 2, Grudge Match, and The Many Saints  of Newark.</p>
      <p>In 2010, Diaz started to gain widespread notoriety from his  appearances on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast. From 2012 to 2020, Diaz was  the host of his own podcast, The Church of What's Happening Now.</p>
      <p>In  June 1985, Diaz left New Jersey for good and returned to Colorado to study  economics at the University of Colorado at Boulder. He did not enjoy his time  there, and quit before taking up work selling roofing which earned him money,  but he remained unhappy. Following his arrest for kidnapping and aggravated  robbery, he was sent to prison in 1988, serving 16 months of a four-year  sentence. During his time in prison, Diaz would perform stand-up routines for  his fellow inmates during the weekly film screening event when the projector  broke. It took Diaz a further three years to try stand-up,  despite being often told of his talent, and later called his entry into the  line of work as &quot;the last resort&quot; as he had many other jobs in the  past. After seeing the 1988 film Punchline, Diaz responded to an advertisement  for a $37 stand-up comedy course in the Rocky Mountain Post, and developed a  blue comedy act. Before he did his first standup routine, he worked as a  doorman at Wit's End.</p>
