      <h3>About Chris d'elia</h3>
      <p>Christopher William D'Elia (born March 29, 1980) is an  American stand-up comedian, actor, writer, and podcast host. He is known for  playing Alex Miller on the NBC sitcom Whitney, Danny Burton on the NBC sitcom  Undateable, Kenny on the ABC television series The Good Doctor and Henderson on  the Netflix thriller series You.<br>
        D'Elia started acting in high school and had some guest  roles on Chicago Hope.He attended New York University and studied acting, but  dropped out after a year because he did not like college.He then appeared in a  movie that went straight to DVD. During his downtime as an actor, he started  writing scripts. When he was 25 he decided to try stand-up comedy, which he had  always wanted to do.<br>
        D'Elia has been performing stand-up comedy since 2006. His  first set was at the Ha Ha Café in North Hollywood. He considers himself to be  a stand-up comedian who acts. He has been featured on Comedy Central's Live at  Gotham, Comedy Central Presents, and Showtime's Live Nude Comedy. He was  introduced to a broader audience as a regular on the series Glory Daze,which  ran for one season on TBS. He was initially cast only for the pilot and was  later made a series regular. He then co-starred in the NBC comedy series  Whitney, opposite comedian Whitney Cummings, for two seasons.<br>
        D'Elia was one of three hosts of the Ten Minute Podcast  (2012–2015), along with Bryan Callen and Will Sasso. Since February 2017, he  has hosted the weekly podcast Congratulations with Chris D'Elia, which has  charted in the top 20 comedy podcasts in multiple countries.[citation needed]  Listeners of the podcast are often referred to as 'Babies'. Other podcasts have  been heavily influenced by his style, including The Fighter and the Kid. D'Elia  also gained over 2 million followers on Vine.<br>
        On December 6, 2013, D'Elia's first one-hour stand-up  special, White Male Black Comic, aired on Comedy Central. He has had three  subsequent comedy specials: Incorrigible (2015), Man On Fire (2017) and No Pain  (2020), all of which aired on Netflix. These were directed by his father, with  the exception of No Pain which was directed by his brother.<br>
        In 2016, D'Elia headlined the Leafly 420 Comedy Tour show in  Chicago with special guest Ron Funches. In March 2019, it was announced that  D'Elia had been cast in the recurring role of Henderson on the second season of  the Netflix thriller series You.<br>
      On an April 2018 episode of his Congratulations podcast,  D'Elia imitated rapper Eminem and made fun of Eminem's middle-aged fans, while  conceding that Eminem was &quot;one of the best rappers of all time&quot;.  Positive reaction to that imitation led D'Elia to imitate Eminem's rapping  again in videos he posted online in September 2018 (in his car) and January  2019 (in his garage). In February 2019, Eminem posted the garage video on his  Twitter account, writing, &quot;This is INCREDIBLE!!! 4 a second I actually thought  it WAS me!!&quot; The May 2019 single &quot;Homicide&quot; by Logic featuring  Eminem then included an audio clip from the car video at the end of the song.  D'Elia said that it was a &quot;huge honor&quot; to be included in the song and  that he did not ask for any royalties. D'Elia then had a substantial role in  the music video for the song, released in June 2019, which had each rapper's  part performed/lip-synced by someone else: Logic's part was performed by actor  Chauncey Leopardi (in reference to a humorous internet meme that claimed that  the two were the same person), Eminem's part was performed by D'Elia, and  D'Elia's part was performed by Eminem, mimicking the appearance of D'Elia in  the car video.</p>
